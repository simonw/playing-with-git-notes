# playing-with-git-notes

This repo is for trying out tricks involving the [git notes](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-notes) feature.

I started it out with a full clone of [sqlite-utils](https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-utils) to give me commits to experiment on.

See [issue #1](https://github.com/simonw/playing-with-git-notes/issues/1) for notes on what I've figured out so far.

It turns out GitHub removed support for displaying notes in the GitHub web UI [in August 2014](https://github.blog/2010-08-25-git-notes-display/).
